NOTE: This document is for those people who are relatively new to github but know the basic concepts like
repositories and commits etc. For experts this document can act as a revision document. Happy reading!! :)

Some commands are:
1. Creating a repository:
-->git init
**You need to be in the repository that is to be initialised as the git repository**

2. Checking status:
-->git status
**Command gives the current status of the the repository irrestective of file being commited or not.
Status includes wheether file is 'tracked' or 'untracked' or 'modified' etc.**

3.Adding file:
-->git add <file_to_add>	**Adds the specified file to staging area**
	OR
-->git add .	**Adds all untracked files to staging area**
	OR
-->git add *.<extension>	**Adds all files with the specified extension**
**Adding is only done to the staging area and not to the final commit straight away!!**

4.Making a commit:
-->git commit
**Command redirects to an editor where you have to specify some description regarding the commit.
This commits the files that were present in the staging area only!!**

5.Unstaging a file:
-->git rm --commit<file_name>
**Removes the file from the staging area  and transfers it back to the modification area.**

6.Changed files:
-->git diff
**Command shows the changes made to the files. Command works only when the file is in the unstaged area.
For staged files:**
-->git diff --staged

Some more commands coming up in the next update.
Thank you!! :)
